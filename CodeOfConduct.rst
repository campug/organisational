Code of conduct
===============

CamPUG (the Cambridge Python User Group) wants to provide a comfortable
environment for anyone to discuss Python and other related matters of
interest.

As such, anyone attending a CamPUG meeting or event, or using our online
venues (including our meetup.com and google group pages) is required to
conform to the following code of conduct.

The short version
-----------------
Be kind to and considerate of others. Consider how what you say or do may be
perceived by those around you.

We wish to provide a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of
gender, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race,
or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of CamPUG participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for an audience including people of
many different backgrounds and ages.

The longer version
------------------
Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the
CamPUG organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including (but
not limited to) warning the offender, expelling them from a meeting, or
banning them from future meetings.

If you are being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Tibs,
either at the meeting (if appropriate) or by email at tibs@tonyibbs.co.uk,
providing as much information as possible. All information reported will be
kept confidential.
